# Portfolio

My website to showcase my work experience, projects, and skills.

## Description

**Tech Used:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript

I needed a place to share a bit about me and show off what I've done/do.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned the importance of having a mock-up before beginning to actually code. The site went through a couple revisions as I felt underwhelmed with my initial designs.
